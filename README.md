In here you will find the main part of my work during my M2 internship (2022) on pupillometry as a measure of visual mental imagery.
It contains experiments, tables and analysis. Each subfolder that require more info has its proper "README" file.

In Experiments, you will find 3 experiments that can be run: Perception First (PF/KR), Imagery First (IF) and Pupil Cycle Time (PCT).
In Analysis, you will find the analysis of the data recorded for both PF, IF and QMI (Online: https://enquetes-screen.msh-alpes.fr/index.php/927978?lang=en).
In Tables, you will find different tables (csv and xlsx) that have been created for further analysis, mostly in the Analysis python codes.
In More, you will find images of protocols and questionnaires.
