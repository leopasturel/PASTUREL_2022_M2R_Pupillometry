For IF and KR (=PF), Python scripts are segregated in many cells.
Each cell specificity is presented in cell 0 and each cell can be easily retrieved with a simple Ctrl-F "Cell x" with x the cell number
In their subfolders, there are data_asc folders that contains all data of our experiment in the ASCII format.
